Project Guidelines:   Collaborate as a team, sharing responsibilities.   Follow group-work best practices.   Store code in a single public GitHub repo; do not add instructors as collaborators.   Merge changes via Pull Requests.   Use DOM, Web Storage, and Fetch APIs.   Style exclusively with TailwindCSS.
